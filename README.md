# [JSL08]: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

In this project, we are implementing the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information in a JavaScript-based banking system. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. By using this pattern, we aim to efficiently manage the bank's branch information just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## Development Objectives

The development objectives of this project include:
- Implementing the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.
- Creating a class called BankBranch for managing branch information and ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application.
- Adding methods to the BankBranch class for managing branch-related information, such as retrieving branch details.
- Verifying that instances of the BankBranch class are referring to the same instance by comparing them using ===.
<!-- 
A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services. -->


## ðŸ“šWhat I Learned

Through the development this project, I learned about the Singleton pattern and its significance in ensuring that a class has only one instance and providing a global access point to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful for managing shared resources such as database connections, logging, caching, and thread pool in a way that ensures consistency and efficiency across the application. This project gave me the ability to be able to create a function with the Singleton Pattern.
