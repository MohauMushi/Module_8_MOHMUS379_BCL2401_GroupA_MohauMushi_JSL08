# [JSL08]: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

In this project, we are implementing the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information in a JavaScript-based banking system. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. By using this pattern, we aim to efficiently manage the bank's branch information just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## Development Objectives

The development objectives of this project include:
- Implementing the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.
- Creating a class called BankBranch for managing branch information and ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application.
- Adding methods to the BankBranch class for managing branch-related information, such as retrieving branch details.
- Verifying that instances of the BankBranch class are referring to the same instance by comparing them using ===.

## ðŸ“šWhat I Learned

Through the development this project, I learned about the Singleton pattern and its significance in ensuring that a class has only one instance and providing a global access point to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful for managing shared resources such as database connections, logging, caching, and thread pool in a way that ensures consistency and efficiency across the application. This project gave me the ability to be able to create a function with the Singleton Pattern.
